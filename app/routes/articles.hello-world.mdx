## A Curious Beginning

My journey in the tech world began long before I realized it was a career path. As a curious and tech-savvy kid, I was captivated by the potential of the digital world. When [Wix launched in 2006](https://www.wix.com/), I eagerly dove into its platform, tinkering with website templates and exploring the boundaries of design and functionality. Within months, I was creating private websites and offering my skills to local businesses. My first projects—building websites for a butcher shop and a florist—may have been small, but they were the foundation of a passion that would shape my professional life.

## Discovering Crypto and Web3

With a deep love for technology driving me, I pursued a degree in Informatics Engineering, where my horizons expanded exponentially. It was in college that I stumbled upon the worlds of cryptocurrency and Web3—a discovery that forever changed my trajectory. The intersection of technology, innovation, and decentralization captured my imagination, and I knew I had found my calling.

## First Steps in Web3

My first step into the Web3 and DeFi space was humble but pivotal: I created a mini-game inspired by Flappy Bird and designed a custom QR code for [ChimpySwap](https://x.com/ChimpySwap), an DEX (Decentralized exchange protocol) on [BSC (Binance Smart Chain)](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain). 

That small project lit a fire within me. The Web3 community’s energy and the constant stream of new projects presented endless opportunities for creativity and growth. 

I began freelancing in the space, tackling projects for over 10 smaller protocols. My roles ranged from creating brand identities and social media illustrations to writing project documentation and crafting engaging articles. 

One of my highlights during this time was working with [Scarab Finance](https://x.com/Scarab_Finance), a Algorithmic token protocol that reached more than 20M in TVL (Total Value Locked) on [FTM (Fantom Blockchain)](https://fantom.foundation/), I designed illustrations for social media and set up [YouTube Livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/live/KcHtb7n_gCw?si=SBB9P9tmPFkOX9WS) to boost the protocol’s visibility.

## Leading at Wavelength Labs

A major turning point in my career came when I joined [Wavelength Labs](https://wavelength.exchange/),an Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol on [Velas Blockchain!](https://velas.com/), as COO and Head of Design. This role was transformative, challenging me to lead marketing efforts, manage a team of social moderators, and collaborate closely with the Velas Chain Foundation. From UI/UX design for the dApp to content creation and strategic planning, I wore many hats. 

While the Velas blockchain presented a tough environment due to investor and user dissatisfaction, our team achieved a historic milestone—becoming the largest protocol ever deployed on the chain. 

The experience was bittersweet, but it taught me resilience and the importance of teamwork in the face of adversity.

## Innovating with PrivatePools

Next came [PrivatePools](https://www.privatepools.network/), an ambitious DeFi project pioneering volatility farming. I was tasked with designing a sophisticated yet user-friendly interface, creating illustrations for documents and social media, and overseeing the front-end development team. 

While the project had immense potential, repeated delays in its launch made me realize it was time to move forward and seek new challenges.

## Finding Purpose at Codestag

At the end of every challenging journey, there’s always a light—and for me, that light was [Codestag](https://codestag.dev/), a development company that specializes in creating decentralized applications. 

Joining Codestag felt like finding my professional home. The company’s mission—to merge cutting-edge design with the power of decentralized systems—resonated deeply with me. 

Together, we’ve built applications that push the boundaries of decentralized technology, blending creativity, functionality, and innovation. From client projects to ongoing development, Codestag has been a space where my passion for design and technology thrives, and I feel privileged to be part of a team shaping the future of Web3.

## A Journey Fueled by Passion

As I reflect on my journey so far, I’m reminded of how far I’ve come—from building websites as a curious kid to leading innovative projects in the cutting-edge world of decentralized technology. Every step, every challenge, and every milestone has been fueled by my unwavering passion for tech and a drive to create meaningful, impactful solutions. And this is just the beginning!
