The first quarter of 2025 was one of the most intense and rewarding phases of my journey as a designer and front-end developer in Web3. I had the opportunity to work on projects that pushed me creatively, technically, and professionally. Looking back, I'm proud of what I built, the ecosystems I contributed to, and the amazing people I collaborated with.

## Kicking Things Off on Abstract with MondrianSwap

The year started with the launch of MondrianSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) deployed on Abstract, a new Ethereum Layer 2 network focused on making the user experience as smooth as possible. Abstract is still in its early stages, with most traction coming from NFT projects, so launching a DeFi protocol there came with its own challenges.

On this project, I was responsible for everything from brand identity to UI/UX design, as well as building the front-end for both the landing page and the dApp.

MondrianSwap introduced Weighted Pools, Stable Pools, and Smart Order Routing ‚Äî solid DeFi mechanics for a chain still growing its DeFi base. Despite tough conditions, including no direct foundation support, the project reached over **$100K** in TVL. It wasn't a breakout success, but under the circumstances, it was a strong result and a great foundation to build from.

## Hand of God: A Major Win on Sonic

Then came Hand of God, without a doubt the biggest project I've worked on so far ‚Äî built on Sonic, the highest-performing EVM L1 out there, capable of 400,000 TPS with sub-second finality. It's tailor-made for DeFi, and it shows.

For Hand of God, I wore many hats:

- Created the brand identity
- Designed and built the UI/UX for both the dApp and landing page
- Developed marketing content
- Managed the AI bot at the core of the protocol

The protocol itself was next-level ‚Äî inspired by Tomb Finance but supercharged with AI-driven automation. The AI runs on-chain analysis every 6 hours, adapting supply mechanisms in real-time to keep the peg stable and emissions optimized.

The launch exceeded all expectations ‚Äî with **$27M+** TVL and thousands of users globally. Later on, I also designed the upcoming veNFT UI/UX, crafting a smooth experience for both the NFTs dApp and its new landing page.

## Snake Finance: Another Sonic Success
Around the same time, I was invited to work on Snake Finance, also on the Sonic blockchain. My role here focused on design, where I revamped the landing page UI and created marketing materials to support the team.

This project stood out because of the team dynamic ‚Äî a brilliant solo developer and two incredibly competent business devs. Their synergy made things move fast and clean, and it paid off: Snake Finance hit **$11M+** in TVL shortly after launch.

## Wrapping Up Q1 2025
Q1 2025 was everything I had hoped for ‚Äî fast-paced, creative, experimental, and full of growth. From launching on newer chains like Abstract to helping scale massive projects on Sonic, I got to be part of projects that tested boundaries and reached real users.

Now Q2 is here, and there's more in the pipeline. Can't wait to build and share what's next.

Let's keep it going.
